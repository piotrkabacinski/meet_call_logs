# Google Meet Logs

Chromium extension for logging Google Meet calls end times (and maybe more information in the future).

To test it, simply load project's `dist` content as browser [extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).

⚠️ Extension depends on Google Meet's Polish internalization 🇵🇱.

## Development

```
npm i
```

```
npm run build
```

Each update requires manual update of the extension in the browser.
